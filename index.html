      Designed, built and piloted a custom pod racer. 32 BBY Boonta Eve<br> 
      Classic Race Champion
    </p>

    <p class="s5">
      In my spare time at Wald’s Parts junk shop I designed and built a Class III open cockpit Podracer capable of <br>
      588 mph top speed. Went on to win the Boonta Eve Classic race in 32 BBY - first ever win by a human. <br>
      Generated documented company revenue of over 59 wupiupi during the course of my enslavement.

    <p class="s2">
      Oversight of DS1 and DS2 Orbital Battle Stations construction projects
    </p>
    <p class="s5">
      During my tenure as a Supreme Imperial Fleet Commander I was in charge of large capital construction projects <br>
      for the Deep Space Fleet. Performed acceptance testing of the DS1 SuperLaser in 0 BBY by annihilating <br>
      Alderaan - a terrestrial class planet in the Core Worlds region. Successfully tripled the deep space fire power of <br>
      the imperial fleet in accordance with the Tarkin Doctrine before losing both projects to run-away photon <br>
      torpedoes.
